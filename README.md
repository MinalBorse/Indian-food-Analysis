# Indian-food-Analysis
##Summary:¶
My mid term project: I choose food dataset because india is so diverse and even I dont know fully what are the cusine by region and I love cooking and I think even I will get to learn new things about indian food culture.The data source is from Archana's Kitchen website. Archana's story from working as an Engineer to becoming one of the most successful food bloggers is really facinating and also reason for me to work on this project.

In this presentation I will cover different Indian cusine and Diet variationals. Also, I will anlysis different indgredients used in indian cooking different meal courses and diet .

My First observation from the pie chart that represent variation of different Diet is that majorities of variation in recipes are Vegeternian and its quite higher than 69 percent as few diet such as satvaic(No garlic No onion) and High protein Vegeterian diet are part of Vegeterian diet.

Fun fact is that Although india has lowest meat consumption rate but only 29% population is vegeterian, majority of people are non vegeterian. Goat, chicken, and lamb are popular meats used in many dishes. Seafood is also popular in coastal areas. In india Vegetarianism became popular after the introduction of Buddhism and Jainism which was around 6th Century BC

My second observation is that the top spices used in india's everyday cooking are brough to india by foreign traders for example Potatoes, tomatoes, and chilies didn’t originate in Indian cuisine. Portuguese traders introduced these items to the country in the 15th and 16th centuries. Saffron was likely brought to India by Greek or Roman traders and now it is used in nearly every sweet dishes.And fun fact is that India is the Spice Capital of the World and largest producers of spices.

My third observation is that most of the everyday recipes have preparation time and cooking time between 0 to 100 minutes but Many pulses recipe like pindi channa has cooking time of 620 minutes mainly because the pulses has to be kept in the in water for 8-9 hours before cooking. Most of High protein recipes have high preparation time because of indegrediients such as cottage cheese has to kept aside for 6-5 houres to solidifiy but then cookinmg time is quite low for few recioes

I have decide to use chi test method to test the hypothesis that is - 'If food serving is more than cooking time should be more' and I got P value of 0.0. Thus, I can reject null hypothesis.

As, Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

Thus, my fourth observation is that More than 50% of dishes are spicy in flavor but as you go from north to south the spices level get incresed due to the fact that north has high milk prodution and they often use cream in their food like butter chiken, shahi paneer.

Also the fun fact is that Naan bread, which is traditionally associated with Indian cuisine, most likely originated in Persia, in the 1300s. The popular Indian dish, Chicken Tikka Masala was first made in Scotland in 1971.

According to Indian Food Theory, our food has 6 different flavours: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy. A proper Indian meal is a perfect balance of all 6 flavours, with one or two flavours standing out. So the next time you eat your meal, you know how to judge it
