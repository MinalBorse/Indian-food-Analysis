**Indian food Analysis**


My mid term project consist of Data visualization on the food recipies from Archana's Kitchen website. Archana's story from working as an Engineer to becoming one of the most successful food bloggers is really facinating and also reason for me to work on this project.
Moreover, I choose this dataset becuse India is so diverse and even I dont know fully what are the cusine by region  and  I love cooking and I think even I will get to learn new things about Indian food culture.

In this presentation, I will cover different  Indian cusine and Diet variationas. Also, I will analysis different indegredients used and cooking time  for different meal courses and diet .

Diet
As it is quite clear from the pie chart that represnt different Diet is Majorities of variation in recipes are Vegeternian  and its quite higher than  69  percent as  few diet such as satvaic(No garlic No onion) and High protein Vegeterian diet are part of Vegeteeial diet

fun fact is that  Although india has lowest meat consumption rate  but only 29% population is vegeterial majority are non vegeterian and Goat, chicken, and lamb are popular meats used in many dishes. Seafood is also popular in coastal areas.
In india Vegetarianism became popular after the introduction of Buddhism and Jainism which was around 6th Century BC

Ingredients 
As this are the top spices used in indias everyday cooking but many spices are brough to india by foreign traders. for example
Observation-Potatoes, tomatoes, and chilies didnâ€™t originate in Indian cuisine. Portuguese traders introduced these items to the country in the 15th and 16th centuries. Saffron was likely brought to India by Greek or Roman traders and now it is used in nearly every sweet dishes.

And fun fact is that India is the Spice Capital of the World and largest producers of spices

Indian Cusine and Cooking time
Most of the everyday recipes  have preparation time and cooking time between 0 to 100 minutes but 
Many pulses recipe like pindi channa has cooking time of 620 minutes mainly because the pulses has to be kept in the in water for 8-9 hours before cooking. 
And most of High protein recipes have high preparation time because of indegrediients such as cottage cheese has to kept aside for 6-5 houres to solidifiy but then cookinmg time is quite low for few recioes

hypothesis.. I have decide to use chi test method to test the hypothesis that is - if food serving  is more than cooking time should be more and I got P value of 0,0 so I can reject null hypothesis.

Indian Course and cusine
Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits
According to Indian Food Theory, our food has 6 different flavours: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy.
A proper Indian meal is a perfect balance of all 6 flavours, with one or two flavours standing out. So the next time you eat your meal, you know how to judge it
Observation :
More than 58% of the dishes are spicy in flavor but as you go from north to south the spices level get incresed due to the fact that north has high milk prodution and they often use cream yougurt in their food like butter chiken, shahi paneer they are least spices dishes 
Least number of dishes are sour in flavor
Also the fun fact is that Naan bread, which is traditionally associated with Indian cuisine, most likely originated in Persia, in the 1300s. The popular Indian dish, Chicken Tikka Masala was first made in Scotland in 1971.
